# Calorie Counter

A simple Calorie Counter app built using JavaScript. I built this project while learning in the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms** course. The CSS for styling was generated using AI.

## Features
- Users can input food items and their calorie values
- Displays total calorie intake dynamically
- Provides an option to remove food items from the list

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (AI-generated styling)
- JavaScript 

## What I Learned
- DOM manipulation techniques to update the UI dynamically
- Handling user inputs and storing data temporarily
- Event listeners for real-time interaction
- Updating and displaying dynamic content
- Basic form validation in JavaScript
